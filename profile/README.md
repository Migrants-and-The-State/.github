**What is Migrants and the State?**

*[Migrants and the State: Unlocking the Potential of A-files for the Histories of U.S. Immigration](https://migrantsandthestate.org/)* is a collaborative, interdisciplinary digital project that aims to provide curated access to the hundreds of thousands of migrant records held by the U.S. National Archives (NARA). These records, known as A-files, open a rare window on migrant experiences and the operations of the administrative state and have exceptional potential for humanities research as well as for explorations in personal, family, and community history.
